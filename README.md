# Change Data Capture with CockroachDB and Strimzi

## Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need the following for this tutorial:

* [oc CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).
* [Strimzi CLI](https://github.com/systemcraftsman/strimzi-kafka-cli#installation).
* A [30-days trial license](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-cockroachdb/enterprise/) for CockroachDB, which is required to use CockroachDB's CDC feature.
* You must have Strimzi 0.26.1 or AMQ Streams 2.1.0 operator installed on your OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.
* You must have CockroachDB 2.3.0 operator installed on your OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.

## CockroachBank's Request

Suppose that you are a consultant who works with a customer, CockroachBank LLC.

They use CockroachDB on OpenShift and their daily bank account transactions are kept in CockroachDB.
Currently, they have a mechanism for indexing the bank account transaction changes in Elasticsearch but they noticed that it creates data inconsistencies between the actual data and the indexed log data that is in Elasticsearch.

They want you to create a core mechanism that avoids any data inconsistency issue between systems.
They require you to create a basic implementation of a CDC by using CockroachDB's `Changefeed` mechanism and because they use CockroachDB on OpenShift, they would like you to use Strimzi.

You must only implement the CDC part, so do not need to implement the Elasticsearch part.
To simulate the CockroachBank system, you must install the AMQ Streams and CockroachDB operators on your OpenShift cluster and create their instances.

The following image is the architectural diagram of the system they require you to implement:

## Creating a Strimzi Cluster

To create a Strimzi cluster, you need a namespace/project created on your OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.
You can use the `oc` CLI to create a namespace/project.

```shell
oc new-project cockroachbank
```

Run the `kfk` command of Strimzi CLI to create a Kafka cluster with one broker.
A small cluster with one broker is enough for a demo.

```shell
export STRIMZI_KAFKA_CLI_STRIMZI_VERSION=0.26.1 && \
kfk clusters --create \
--cluster my-cluster \
--replicas 1 \
--zk-replicas 1 \
-n cockroachbank -y
```

---
**NOTE**

You can download the Strimzi CLI Cheat Sheet from [here](https://www.systemcraftsman.com/strimzi-cli-cheat-sheet/) for more information about the CLI commands.

---

Verify that you have all the Strimzi pods up and running in `Ready` state.

```shell
oc get pods -n cockroachbank
```

The output should be as follows:

```shell
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    ...
...output omitted...
my-cluster-entity-operator-64b8dcf7f6-cmjz8   3/3     Running   ...
my-cluster-kafka-0                            1/1     Running   ...
my-cluster-zookeeper-0                        1/1     Running   ...
...output omitted...
```

## Running CockroachDB on OpenShift

To install CockroachDB on your OpenShift cluster, [download the CockroachDB cluster custom resource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/systemcraftsman/strimzi-cockroachdb-demo/main/resources/crdb-cluster.yaml?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABM2AIEVUBWSZFA2QWKHQ7XOYVGRUCQ), which the CockroachDB operator creates the cluster for you by using the resource definition you provide in the YAML.

The YAML content should be as follows:

```yaml
kind: CrdbCluster
apiVersion: crdb.cockroachlabs.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: crdb-tls-example
  namespace: cockroachbank
spec:
  cockroachDBVersion: v21.1.10
  dataStore:
    pvc:
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 10Gi
        volumeMode: Filesystem
  nodes: 3
  tlsEnabled: false
```

Run the following command to apply the resource YAML on OpenShift.

```shell
oc create -f crdb-cluster.yaml -n cockroachbank
```

Verify that you have all the CockroachDB pods up and running in `Ready` state.

```shell
oc get pods -n cockroachbank
```

The output should be as follows:

```shell
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    ...
...output omitted...
crdb-tls-example-0                            1/1     Running   ...
crdb-tls-example-1                            1/1     Running   ...
crdb-tls-example-2                            1/1     Running   ...
...output omitted...
```

In another terminal run the following command to access CockroachDB SQL client interface:

```shell
oc rsh -n cockroachbank crdb-tls-example-0 cockroach sql --insecure
```

On the SQL client interface, run the following commands to enable the trial for enterprise usage.
You must do this because CDC is a part of the `Enterprise Changefeeds` and you need an enterprise license.
Refer to the `Prerequisites` part of this tutorial if you did not get a trial license yet.

```shell
SET CLUSTER SETTING cluster.organization = '_YOUR_ORGANIZATION_';
```

```shell
SET CLUSTER SETTING enterprise.license = '_YOUR_LICENSE_';
```

## Creating and Configuring a CockroachDB Table

On the SQL query client terminal window, run the following command to create a database called `bank` on CockroachDB.

```sql
root@:26257/defaultdb> CREATE DATABASE bank;
```

Select the `bank` database to use for the rest of the actions in the query window.

```sql
root@:26257/defaultdb> USE bank;
```

Create a table called `account` with the `id` and `balance` fields.

```sql
root@:26257/bank> CREATE TABLE account (id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance INT);
```

Create a `Changefeed` for the table `account`.
Set the Strimzi Kafka cluster broker address for the Changefeed, to specify the broker to send the captured change data:

```sql
root@:26257/bank> CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE account INTO 'kafka://my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092' WITH UPDATED;
```

Notice that the Kafka bootstrap address is `my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092`.
This is the service URL that Strimzi provides for the Kafka cluster `my-cluster` you have created.

---
**NOTE**

For more information on creating a `Changefeed` on CockroachDB refer to this [documentation page](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v21.2/create-changefeed).

---

Leave the terminal window open for further instructions.

## Creating a Strimzi Topic and Consuming Data

In another terminal window run the following command to create a topic called `account`:

```shell
kfk topics --create --topic account \
--partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 \
-c my-cluster -n cockroachbank
```

The output must be as follows:

```shell
kafkatopic.kafka.strimzi.io/account created
```

---
**IMPORTANT**

A topic with 1 partition and 1 replication factor is enough for this demonstration.
If you have a Strimzi Kafka cluster with more than 1 broker, then you can configure your topic differently.

---

Notice that it is the same name as the CockroachDB table `account`.
CockroachDB CDC produces change data into a topic with the same name as the table by default.

In the same terminal window run the following command to start consuming from the `account` topic:

```shell
kfk console-consumer --topic account \
-c my-cluster -n cockroachbank
```

Leave the terminal window open to see the consumed messages for the further steps.

## Capturing the Change Event Data

In the SQL client terminal window, run the following command to insert a sample account data into the `account` table.

```sql
root@:26257/bank> INSERT INTO account (id, balance) VALUES (1, 1000), (2, 250), (3, 700);
```

This should create the following accounts in the CockroachDB `account` table:


| **id**              | **balance**                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 1000                   |
| 2               | 250                                           |
| 3 | 700 |

After inserting the data, verify that the Strimzi CLI consumer prints out the consumed data:

```
{"after": {"balance": 1000, "id": 1}, "updated": "1655075852039229718.0000000000"}
{"after": {"balance": 250, "id": 2}, "updated": "1655075852039229718.0000000000"}
{"after": {"balance": 700, "id": 3}, "updated": "1655075852039229718.0000000000"}
```

To observe some more event changes on the topic data, run the following queries on the SQL client to change the balance between accounts.


```sql
root@:26257/bank> UPDATE account SET balance=700 WHERE id=1;
root@:26257/bank> UPDATE account SET balance=600 WHERE id=2;
root@:26257/bank> UPDATE account SET balance=650 WHERE id=3;
```

Verify that the new changes, which CDC of CockroachDB captures, are printed out by the Strimzi CLI consumer.
In the consumer's terminal window, you should see a result as follows:

```
...output omitted...
{"after": {"balance": 700, "id": 1}, "updated": "1655075898837400914.0000000000"}
{"after": {"balance": 600, "id": 2}, "updated": "1655075904775509980.0000000000"}
{"after": {"balance": 650, "id": 3}, "updated": "1655075910511670876.0000000000"}
```

Notice the balance changes that represent a transaction history in the consumer output.

As the last step, delete the bank account to see how CockroachDB CDC captures them.
Run the following SQL query in the query console of CockroachDB:

```sql
root@:26257/bank> DELETE FROM account where id <> 0;
```

The Strimzi CLI consumer should print the following captured events:

```
...output omitted...
{"after": null, "updated": "1655075949177132715.0000000000"}
{"after": null, "updated": "1655075949177132715.0000000000"}
{"after": null, "updated": "1655075949177132715.0000000000"}
```

Notice that the `after` field becomes `null` when the change data is a `delete` event.

Congratulations! You've successfully captured the bank account transaction changes, and streamed them as change events via Strimzi.

## Conclusion
